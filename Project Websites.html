         <h1>The United States Drug Overdose Crisis</h1>
         <p>The United States is currently facing an unprecedented public health crisis in the form of opioid overdoses. Over the past two decades, the rates of drug overdose deaths have skyrocketed, with opioids like prescription painkillers, heroin, and especially synthetic opioids like fentanyl being the primary culprits. This epidemic has touched every corner of the nation, impacting people of all ages, races, and socioeconomic backgrounds. The devastating consequences extend beyond the staggering loss of life, also tearing apart families, straining healthcare and emergency services, and causing immense social and economic harm to communities. Urgent action is needed to prevent further tragedy, treat those struggling with addiction, and address the root causes of this multifaceted crisis.</p>
         <p>The population in the United States has increased over the last several decades, despite the yearly percentage change decreasing. The overdose rates in the United States have also increased over the last several decades.  </p>

         <p>From 2000 to 2020, the population of the United States grew from 281.4 million to 331.0 million, an increase of 17.6%. However, during this same 20 year period, drug overdose deaths surged at a much faster rate. In 2000, there were 17,415 overdose deaths (6.2 per 100,000 people). By 2020, that number had catapulted to 91,799 deaths (27.7 per 100,000), a staggering increase of 427%. Opioids, primarily prescription painkillers, heroin, and synthetic opioids like fentanyl, have been the main drivers of this increase. In 2000, opioids were involved in 8,407 overdose deaths. In 2020, that number reached 68,630, accounting for nearly 75% of all overdose deaths. The opioid epidemic has hit virtually all segments of the U.S. population, crossing boundaries of age, race, gender, and geography. </p>
